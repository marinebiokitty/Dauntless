RING PLOT:
-> airship-gms / ring.plot / dvp  15:45    (Phaeton)
       Okay. Here's what happened.
   airship-gms / ring.plot / dvp  15:46    (Phaeton)
       Late last night. Noble loses his ring while with the plantnpcwhore.
   airship-gms / ring.plot / dvp  15:46    (Phaeton)
       She finds it in the morning, says "Oh, it's cute, it must have fallen out of
       jewelry collection, and even if it's the Noble's its mine now HAHA"
   airship-gms / ring.plot / dvp  15:47    (Phaeton)
       She thinks the Robot Boy is cute, and he claims to be an engineer so she
       gives it to him to clean/hold on to.
   airship-gms / ring.plot / dvp  15:47    (Phaeton)
       Robot plays with the ring, leaves her a thank you note, and is going to
       return the ring but then *GAMESTARTS* the whore is dead.
   airship-gms / ring.plot / dvp  15:47    (Phaeton)
       So to win, the Noble has to break into her room, find that the Robot has it,
       and convince him to give it over.
   airship-gms / ring.plot / dvp  15:47    (Phaeton)
       Hot.

---------------------------------------
ROBOT FIX / GROWING UP PLOT:
players: Robot, Vicar, Cid, Curie, Dealer

We need a way for the Robot to be slowly fixed and repogrammed and made better. He can do some of it himself, but needs the help of others. They each want him to be something. The Vicar - a priest, Cid - a career engineer, Currie - an evil sidekick/son, Dealer - a groomed protege. Make it so that by spending a lot of time / energy on Robot, and by giving him what he wants, you can win this plot. Somebody write this. I pass it on to you. Not me. Unless you really want me to do it. If I hear no response, I'll just do it.

--------------------------------------
POLITICAL PLOT:
players: Noble, Cowboy, Saboteur

Ash, please write us something. I delegate. It needs to have involved Boddy.
--------------------------------------
WEREWOLF PLOT:
players: Vicar

Make him have to find items and mix potions and take weird actions by certain deadlines or else he TURNS INTO A WEREWOLF AGAIN every hour on the hour. Who wants to write? I volunteer to write this one.
---------------------------------

OPIUM PLOT has been detailed elsewhere, in mail that I sent. So has the FIX / DESTROY AIRSHIP plot.

---------------------------------------
--------------------------------------
Our zampolit says we should have three solid ones per person. Not counting "roleplaying" plots as solid plots (although maybe we should!), here is how many we have left with appropriate suggestions:

Cid: 1 more
--reconcile with parents somehow?

Captain: 1 more
--make Dealer prove his worthiness? watch daughter grow up?
--steer ship?
--something to do with wife?

Thief: 2 more
--loosen up Dealer?
--keep up appearance for Captain?
--SingingLesson mechanic with Whore?

Jack: 2 more, but does she really need any? I'd argue that she doesn't

Whore: 0 more
--SingingLesson mechanic with Thief?

Cowboy: 0 more
--love plot with Saboteur?

Noble: 0 more

Saboteur: 0 more
--love plot with Cowboy?

Curie: 1 more
--sabotage parachutes?
--steer ship somehow?
--something to with husband?

Vicar: 1 more
--watch over thief
--make everyone be moral (bitch at Mdm. Curie for leaving Captain, help Noble (his brother) with whore addiction, help Captain resits Opium, convert Cowboy)

Robot Boy: 1 more
I'm out of ides. Who's got some?

Dealer: 0 more
--love plot with Thief?


Honestly, people, that's only seven more solid mechaniced plots (if we ignore Jack). We can totally do seven more plots. We've done 27 already, and we'll be able to fill the rest with RP plots (i.e. Convince the Cowboy to believe in God)
