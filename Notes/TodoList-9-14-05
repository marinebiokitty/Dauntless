This is the huge to-do list for shit in Dauntless that is not yet
done. I'm not listing stuff that is essentially done. 
I'm putting in parenthases who is assigned what job (to the best of my
memory and notes).

A copy of this email is being kept in /Airship/Notes/TodoList-9-14-05

If I am missing anything at all, no matter how trivial, please tell
me. We only have one month. Let's be ambitious and have game in a box
in two and a half weeks (that's two weeks before game). To that end,
here is the todo list. We have, on the average, 5 assignments each, to do in
~>15 days. This translates to finishing something on the todo list
below once every three days. Important: If you do not feel you can do
what is assigned to you in the time, please tell the rest of us now,
so we can redistribute the work. I'd rather pull in overtime *now*
then sweat about it the night before packet handout. Let's communicate
constantly about which of the items below we have knocked off. For
example, I plan to take care of the "Jewelry Heist" and "Singing
Training" plots so that they are done done done *tonight*. I hope
you'll join with me and tool. If you do not respond, I will track you
the fuck down. The list:

Character Sheets (4 ~done, 4 in progress, 4 not started)
--Polish captain.tex (dvp)
--Polish cid.tex (spaige)
--Finish writing cowboy.tex (ash)
--Finish writing curie.tex (laura)
--Write dealer.tex (ash?)
--Finish writing jack.tex (laura)
--Write noble.tex (dvp)
--Write robot.tex (laura?)
--Write saboteur.tex (ash)
--Polish thief.tex (dvp)
--Finish writing vicar.tex (spaige)
--Polish whore.tex (dvp)
Other sheets:
--Finish Bomb-difuse sheet (spaige)
--Finish Werewolf / Sin and Redemption sheet/mechanics (spaige)
Plots to be implemented/written up:
--Write International Politics Plot (ash)
--Write "Robot boy grows up" research notebook (laura)
--Write Fix Robot/Fix Cowboy sheets (spaige)
--Finish Jewelry Heist plot (dvp)
--Finish Singing Training plot (dvp)
All-Game:
--Create all of gamespace (I've been doing little bits of this - do we
want to have a Gamespace Czar?)
--Create rules/scenario handout
--Decide where to run game, send in request for rooms.
Promotion:
--Create Poster for Foley (spaige or ash?)

I am stressed out and hosed this term (already, yay), but I really
want to get this game done on time and have it be good. I want to give
a fair warning that if you are lame or will drop off the face of the
Earth I will be upset and stressed and write a bad game. I can imagine
that things might get ugly if we hold off on writing until the last
minute, so let's nip that problem in the bud and start tooling now.
Please send me mail back within 24 hours to tell me if I have the todo list
assignments correct, if you can do what is assigned to you, what your
timeline looks like and anything else relevant about details of the
game and/or your work ability.

Thanks. Let's finish this game!
