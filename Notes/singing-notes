singing lessons

Curie and Whore both have the ability to teach Thief how to sing. However, each teaches differently. The performance is at 10:30 in the ballroom. The Thief needs 10 lessons total to be prepared. If she is taught less than ten times, she loses.

If she is at the Ballroom at 10:30, she opens a memory packet. The memory packet asks her how many "alpha"s and "beta"s she has on her "singing ability card". Take the stat (alpha-beta). If she has:

10: catastrophic failure
6: really bad
2: bare competency
-2: decent music
-6: pretty damn good
-10: gloriously amazing
