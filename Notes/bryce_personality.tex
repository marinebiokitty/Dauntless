Bryce Personality

The most important thing in life is doing whatever you need to do to
get ahead.  Considering that fact, if that means lying, cheating,
stealing, manpulating people, or whatever, it doesn't matter as long
as you end up getting what you want.  People are means to an end, and
are tools to be used as such.  Trust as few people as possible for as
short as possible, lest they betray you and stab you in the back.
Remember other people are ambitious too, and there is no such thing as
being too paranoid.  In the end, the only person you can trust
completely is yourself.
