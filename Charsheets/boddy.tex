%% Character sheets live in this directory.  This file doubles as a
%% latex'able example charsheet.
%%
%% Character macros (in ../Lists/char-LIST.tex, presumably) each
%% have a file that lives here.  The argument to \name{...} probably
%% should be the macro for the given character, which will generate
%% the charsheet's name (and print out lists of the characters stuff
%% at the end) as specified in char-LIST.tex.  However, you can also
%% just use \name{Some Text} if you want.

%% The itemz environment is a list environment similar to itemize.
%% The typesetting is very tight, and matches that used by the lists
%% at the end of character sheets.  It takes an optional argument that
%% acts as a title for the list.  The enum environment is a similar
%% variation of the enumerate environment, and the desc environment is
%% similar to description.
\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Things to do
  \item Governments to topple
  \item Worlds to dominate
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
  \item You were born in London.
