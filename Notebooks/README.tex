%% Research Notebooks live in this directory.  This file doubles as a
%% latex'able example notebook.
%%
%% Notebook macros (in ../Lists/notebook-LIST.tex, presumably) each
%% have a file that lives here.  The argument to \startnotebook{...}
%% probably should be the macro for the given whitesheet.  However,
%% you can also just use \name{Some Text} if you want.
%%
%% Note that every \startnotebook command needs a matching
%% \endnotebook command.  Also note that no ownership information
%% appears on the notebook.

Get together 3 people who know how to juggle.  Then get 9 juggling
balls.  Have each juggler juggle three at once, such that all 9 are
being juggled at the same time.

If the group can go 1 minute or more without dropping a single ball,
go to step \nbref{1min}.  If they can go for 5 minutes without dropping
a single ball, go to step \nbref{good}.
