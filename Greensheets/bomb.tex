% notes: inside mempacket that Cid opens when she sees the greensheet. Current design: decking, with lots of hassle rules. Also will require tools and a few items. 

-Shuffle deck, try to build poker hand. Items will decrease level of hand needed. (General idea - Cid shouts for supplies a lot, while decking madly. Saboteur probably scurries off to hide the stuff.)
