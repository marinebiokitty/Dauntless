Production/README

This directory is a convenient place from which to run the actual
production of the game.  Editing and elatex'ing the files here is a
straightforward way to print elements for production, compendium, or
runtime.

The \production command is defined for each type of file to do
something appropriate for production.  Similarly, \compendium is
defined to do something appropriate for printing a compendium.  For
example:

  \documentclass[listblue]{game}
  \begin{document}
  \production
  \end{document}

will produce all the bluesheets for each character, sorted by
character.  Replacing \production with \compendium will produce one of
every bluesheet.  Similarly, a list of Char macros will produce the
bluesheets owned by the given characters, and a list of Blue macros
will produce the given bluesheets.  Other options, as demonstrated by
the -PRINT.tex files, are set up in a similar manner.

Generally, \production will handle production of Place macros as well
as Char macros.



Multiple Runs: You can override \gamerun by defining \GAMERUN before
\documentclass.  For example:

  \def\GAMERUN{2}
  \documentclass[listblue]{game}
  \production
  \end{document}

will will produce all the bluesheets for each character for the second
run of the game.
