Dear Honored Guest,

Welcome to the newest and most glorious of Her Majesty's new fleet of airships. 
The crew of the {\it HMS Dauntless} and I request your presence in the airship's 
Ballroom for a special Dedication of the maiden voyage of the {\it Dauntless},
two and a half hours after takeoff. The schedule of events is as follows:

An {\bf Invocation} and welcome speech by the {\it Captain}.

A {\bf Display} of the famous "Neptune's Tear", worn by {\it Lady Gwendolyn Major}.

A singing {\bf Performance} by my lovely daughter, {\it Miss Mary Elizabeth Archer}.

A {\bf Convocation} by my brother, the Vicar {\it Reginald Archer}.

An ending ceremony and {\bf Toast} by my dear friend {\it Lord Cornelius Blackwell}.

I am looking forward to your company, and please don't forget to gather at the head of the ship at midnight for the Fireworks. My engineers assure me we have an excellent shipment from China.
\\
\\
Sincerely,
\\
\\
\\
Captain John Archer
